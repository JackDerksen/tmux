# tmux_config

## This repository is basically deprecated, and no longer accurately represents the config I use. Feel free to keep using it, of course, but the more updated version can be found at [JackDerksen/viis-dev-kit](https://github.com/JackDerksen/viis-nvim)!

My custom Catppuccin-themed Tmux config, designed to pair perfectly with my [Neovim config](https://github.com/JackDerksen/viis-lazyvim). Inspired by Dreams Of Code and DevOps Toolbox.
Requires tpm for packages, and a [nerd font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) if you want icons.

The leader key is set to `ctrl + space`, the only correct option. This config also has transparent background colours on the status bar, so it should look sexy with any terminal background colour you want to use.

To install on Linux, place tmux.conf in ~/.config/tmux/ , then install packages via tpm with `<leader> + i`.

### Useful Keymaps:
- `<leader> + r` to source/refresh the Tmux config file
- `<leader> + -` to split window horizontally
- `<leader> + |` to split window vertically

### There are two styles in the tmux.conf file, un-comment whichever you prefer!

### Style 1 (simple):

### Style 2 (bubbles):
