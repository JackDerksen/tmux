# tmux_config
My Catppuccin-themed Tmux config, designed to aesthetically fit with my [Neovim config](https://github.com/JackDerksen/viis-lazyvim). Inspired by Dreams Of Code and DevOps Toolbox.

Requires tpm for packages, and a nerd font if you want icons. My leader is `<C-space>`.

On Linux, place tmux.conf in ~/.config/tmux/ , then install packages via npm with `<leader>I`. Press `<C-r>` to source the config file.
